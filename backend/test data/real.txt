GDP and Sectoral Growth: The economy grew by 2.68%, with the services sector leading at 2.91%, followed by industry at 4.77%, and agriculture at a modest 0.56%. The services sector, driven by wholesale, retail trade, and finance, showed consistent improvement, while industrial growth was bolstered by a rebound in large-scale manufacturing, particularly in automobiles and export-oriented industries. Agriculture faced challenges due to a decline in major crop production, though other crops like fruits and vegetables grew by 4.78%.
Inflation and Monetary Policy: Inflation dropped significantly to a record low of 0.3% in April 2025, down from 17.3% the previous year, with average CPI inflation at 4.7% for July-April. Tight monetary policies, exchange rate stability, and administrative measures like curbing hoarding and expanding subsidized markets contributed to this decline.
Fiscal Performance: The fiscal deficit narrowed to 2.6% of GDP from 3.7%, and the primary surplus reached Rs 3,468.7 billion (3.0% of GDP). Tax revenues surged by 26.3%, and non-tax revenues rose by 68%, driven by higher profits from the State Bank of Pakistan and petroleum levies.
External Account: The current account recorded a surplus of US$ 1.9 billion during July-April FY 2025, reversing a US$ 1.3 billion deficit from the previous year. Strong remittance inflows, particularly from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and steady export growth in textiles offset a rise in essential imports. Foreign exchange reserves improved to US$ 16.64 billion by May 27, 2025.
Investment and Savings: National savings stood at 14.1% of GDP, outpacing investment at 13.8%, resulting in a foreign savings surplus of 0.4%. Private investment grew by 9.9%, and public investment, including government development spending, rose by 34.2%. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) reached Rs 13,814.7 billion, up 15.0% from FY 2024.
AI and Economic Transformation: The survey emphasizes Pakistan’s potential to leverage AI for economic growth, highlighting its young demographic and digital consumer base. However, it notes gaps in digital infrastructure and skills, with the government prioritizing reforms under the National Economic Transformation Plan to enhance AI readiness.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the exchange would unfold "in several stages" over the coming days.

Writing on Telegram, he said: "The process is quite complicated, there are many sensitive details, negotiations continue virtually every day."

Russia's defence ministry said "the first group of Russian servicemen under the age of 25 were returned from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime" and that a "similar number" had been returned to Ukraine. Neither side provided an exact figure of how many people had been exchanged.

North Korea has moved a new warship damaged in a botched launch to a port near the Russian border, a move analysts say could point to a role for Moscow in repairing the vessel.

Satellite images taken Sunday by Maxar Technologies show the 5,000-ton destroyer, as yet unnamed, in a drydock in the port of Rajin, part of North Korea’s Rason special economic zone, which abuts its short border with Russia.

While not a major shipbuilding facility like the shipyard in the northeastern city of Chongjin where the launching accident occurred, Rajin has facilities for modest repairs and maintenance, said Yu Jihoon, director of external cooperation and an associate research fellow at Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.

And its proximity to Russia “makes it a key node for North Korea’s efforts to deepen economic and potentially military ties with Moscow,” Yu said.

A 2024 report from the Modern War Institute at West Point, the United States Military Academy, calls the Rason economic zone “a significant point of North Korea–Russia cooperation, recently implicated in North Korean arms shipments to Russia for use in Ukraine.”
